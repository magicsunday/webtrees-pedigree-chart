# Pedigree chart
This module provides an SVG pedigree chart for the [webtrees](https://www.webtrees.net) genealogy application.
It is capable of displaying up to 25 generations of ancestors from an individual.

**But beware, if you select too many generations, it may take a while and even slow down your system significantly.**

## Installation
Requires webtrees 2.2.

There are several ways to install the module. The method using [composer](#using-composer) is suitable
for experienced users, as a developer you can also use [git](#using-git) to get a copy of the repository. For all other users,
however, manual installation is recommended.

### Manual installation
To manually install the module, perform the following steps:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/magicsunday/webtrees-pedigree-chart/releases/latest) of the module.
2. Upload the downloaded file to your web server.
3. Unzip the package into your ``modules_v4`` directory.
4. Rename the folder to ``webtrees-pedigree-chart``

If everything was successful, you should see a subdirectory ``webtrees-pedigree-chart`` with the unpacked content
in the ``modules_v4`` directory.

Then follow the steps described in [configuration](#configuration) and [usage](#usage).


### Using Composer

from the root of your Webtrees installation.

```shell
composer require magicsunday/webtrees-pedigree-chart --update-no-dev
```

The module will automatically install into the ``modules_v4`` directory of your webtrees installation.

To remove the module run:
```shell

```

Then follow the steps described in [configuration](#configuration) and [usage](#usage).

version of the module. For this, please use the following command:
```shell
composer require magicsunday/webtrees-pedigree-chart:dev-master --update-no-dev
```
